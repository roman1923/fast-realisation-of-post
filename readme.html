	This is a brutal, low(no) styled realization of the blog, according to a 4-hour estimate. 
	First of all, set this theme and plugin confs from this repo to your core, then add the About Us page
	in the admin panel and connect it to the template, enter data into the Gutenberg editor. As a result,
	we should have 2 pages in the admin panel About Us and Edit page. Previously we added plugin confs
	and this is good, but we also need to install and activate them(yoast SEO and w3 total cache) from
	admin, we need to manipulate information on the page according to SEO plugin needs/recommendations
	and speed requirements. What about blog logic? We need to log in or register and then log in. After
	that we can create posts, from home, any user can sort by categories and go to the single, from
	single we can see posts and edit or delete them if the current user is the author.
	Anyone can leave a comment. In this code according to the time limit, we don't use a lot of styles,
	package managers like npm and composer, and ACF pro plugin for setting fields dynamically end
	excluding any static, but for scaling the project and setting it to production all this is a must.
