	This is a brutal, low(no) styled realization of the blog, according to 4-hour estimate. 
	First of all set this theme and plugin confs from this repo to your core, then add About us page
	in admin panel and connect it to template, enter data to guttenberg block. In result
	we should have 2 pages in admin panel About and Edit page. Previously added plugin confs is good,
	we need to install and activate yoast seo and w3 total cache from admin, and manipulate information
	on page according SEO plugin needs and recomendations and speed requires. About post, we need to
	login or register and then login. After that we can create posts, from home, sort by categories
	and go to the single, from single we can see post and edit or delete if current user is author.
	Anyone can leave comment.
